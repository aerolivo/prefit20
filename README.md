# PREFIT20

The [PREFIT](https://indico.cern.ch/event/817757/) school offers PhD students 
and early-career investigators a complete 
toolset for precision physics at the LHC, present and future. It brings together 
students from both experimental and theoretical physics, and spans theoretical 
foundations of effective field theory and precision calculations, modern experimental 
techniques, data fitting algorithms and machine learning techniques applied to precision 
analyses in high-energy physics. Lectures by high-profile teachers alternate with 
hands-on sessions led by well-renowned experts of the fields. Under the supervision 
of the experts, students will practice in small groups the newly acquired skills.
